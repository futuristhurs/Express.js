Spring:
Spring is a Java-based framework for building enterprise-level applications. It was first released in 2002 by Rod Johnson, and has since become one of the most popular Java frameworks in use today.

Features:

Dependency injection: Spring provides a powerful dependency injection (DI) mechanism that helps to reduce coupling and improve maintainability of code.

Aspect-oriented programming: Spring provides support for aspect-oriented programming (AOP), which allows developers to encapsulate cross-cutting concerns such as logging, caching, and security.

Data access: Spring provides a range of data access mechanisms, including JDBC, JPA, and NoSQL support.

Integration: Spring provides a range of integration options for working with other technologies such as messaging, caching, and security.

Testing framework: Spring includes a comprehensive testing framework that makes it easy to write and run automated tests for your application.
